#### Song :
* first thng i did was a update Album constructer to add id ,then i created interface class (AlbumReposity)  to connect to data base.

* secound  thing i did was a route ("/songs"), with getAllAlbum method  that will show to me  (albumsForm.html) with form to add sogn after filling the form and submit the song will be saved into database  .

* third thing i did was a new rout  (/getSong) with getAllAlbum method  that accept (Model),
and return (albumsForm.html) that will display the albums in database .
